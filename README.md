# Reinforcement-Learning

Reinforcement Learning(RL) is a type of machine learning technique that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error using feedback from its own actions and experiences.

As compared to unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is different in terms of goals. While the goal in unsupervised learning is to find similarities and differences between data points, in the case of reinforcement learning the goal is to find a suitable action model that would maximize the total cumulative reward of the agent. The figure below illustrates the action-reward feedback loop of a generic RL model.


### Some key terms that describe the basic elements of an RL problem are:

- Environment — Physical world in which the agent operates
- State — Current situation of the agent
- Reward — Feedback from the environment
- Policy — Method to map agent’s state to actions
- Value — Future reward that an agent would receive by taking an action in a particular state
